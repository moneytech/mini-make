Mini Make is an implementation of Make that runs on Windows and Linux.

It is made to run Makefiles generated by [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and with a few other features
from GNU Make.

### Building

CMake is the primary build tool.

To build the project with CMake, do this:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --target all
cmake --build . --target install
```

You can also build the project using
[QMake](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-overview.html).

```
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ..
make
```
